To run the website, please follow these instructions:

Ensure you have a local server environment set up, such as XAMPP, WAMP, or any other similar solution.
Install and configure the local server software on your machine if you haven't already.
Once your local server is running, copy the project files to the appropriate directory. If you're using XAMPP, typically, this would be the htdocs folder. For WAMP users, it would be the www folder.
If you're hosting the project on a web server, you can simply upload the project files directly to the server.
Once the files are in place, open a web browser and navigate to the appropriate URL, depending on your local server setup or hosting configuration.

## Running the Website Locally

To run the website locally, please follow these instructions:

1. **Set up Local Server Environment:**
   - Ensure you have a local server environment set up, such as XAMPP, WAMP, or any other similar solution.
   - Install and configure the local server software on your machine if you haven't already.

2. **Copy Project Files:**
   - Once your local server is running, copy the project files to the appropriate directory.
   - For XAMPP users, typically, this would be the `htdocs` folder.
   - For WAMP users, it would be the `www` folder.

3. **Hosting on Web Server:**
   - If you're hosting the project on a web server, you can simply upload the project files directly to the server.

4. **Accessing the Website:**
   - Once the files are in place, open a web browser.
   - Navigate to the appropriate URL, depending on your local server setup or hosting configuration.
